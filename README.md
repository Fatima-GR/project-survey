# Survey form with React

The goal of this project is to practice React state and form fields by making a Typeform like product.
I decided to build a survey of JavaScript's questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses the button overview, they see a summary of both, their answers and the solutions.

# What have I learned?
- What the purpose of state in React is.
- How to use the `useState` hook in React.
- How to connect HTML form inputs to state.
- How to use form fields with React.
- How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey
