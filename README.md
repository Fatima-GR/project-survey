# Survey form with React

In this week project, I have practiced React state and controlled forms by making a Typeform like product. This project consists of JavaScript's questions that need to be answered by users. When the user presses the button overview, they see a summary of both, their answers and the solutions.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
